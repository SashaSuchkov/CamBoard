A program to replicate movements into keyboard and gamepad signals.

Current loadout:
- head tilt to left and right - LMB and RMB
- left hand - left gamepad stick (displayed as WASD in overlay to avoid confusion between sticks)
- right hand - right gamepad stick
- left leg up (knee higher than pelvis) - Shift
- left leg to the right (foot righter than right knee) - Space

Loadout tested on Ultrakill, completion of 0-4 on Lenient and Standard difficulties successful.

The program needs lots of improvements to be a finished product, but it works fine enough as a study project.
